- ✅ Created comprehensive SHEET_ANALYSIS_V2.md with implementation plan

### 4. Project Cleanup

## Next Work (When Ready)

See **SHEET_ANALYSIS_V2.md** for detailed design:

### Phase 1: User Tracking (4-6 hours)
**Goal**: Track who creates/modifies each node and edge

**Tasks**:
- Capture user email/name on OAuth sign-in
- Add columns: created_by, updated_by, fields_changed
- Populate on save/update operations
- No UI changes (just backend audit trail)

### Phase 2: Personal Sheets (8-12 hours)
**Goal**: Users have private sheets that complement global data

**Tasks**:
- Auto-create personal sheet on first save
- Add checkboxes: "Show Global" / "Show Personal"
- Implement merge logic (Personal wins conflicts)
- Visual distinction (gold borders for personal items)
- Show dialog with personal sheet URL

### Phase 3: Admin Features (4-6 hours)
**Goal**: Admin can track and revert user changes

**Tasks**:
- Activity log UI (filter by user)
- Selective reversion functionality
- Admin panel (if admin email in whitelist)

**Total Estimated Time**: 16-24 hours

---

## Key Decisions Made

### User Tracking Design
1. **Default behavior**: Nodes go to BOTH Global and Personal sheets
2. **Checkboxes control visibility**: Both checked by default
3. **No "signed in as" display**: Focus on audit columns only
4. **Track field changes**: New column lists which fields were modified
5. **Personal sheet auto-creation**: Create and present URL on first save

### Removed Concepts
- ❌ `is_personal` flag (can't work in Global sheet with multiple users)
- ❌ `synced_to_global` timestamp (unnecessary if everything goes to both)
- ❌ `sheet_origin` column (redundant)

### Conflict Resolution
- **Personal wins**: When same node ID in both sheets, Personal overwrites Global
- **User-specific**: Each user sees their customized version
- **Others unaffected**: Other users see Global version

---

## Open Questions (For Next Session)

1. **fields_changed format**: Simple array `["label", "notes"]` or with old/new values?
2. **Both checkboxes off**: Re-check Global automatically or show empty graph?
3. **Admin permissions**: Store admin list in Sheet tab or hardcode in JS?

---

## Context Recovery Information

**For Next AI Session**:

1. **Read these files FIRST**:
   - `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.txt` - Current state overview
   - `AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md` - Development patterns
   - `SHEET_ANALYSIS_V2.md` - Next feature design

2. **Check current state**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   open https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/
   ```

3. **Before any work**:
   - ⚠️ **Create feature branch** (NEVER push to main)
   - Test locally with HTTP server
   - Create PR for all changes

**Live Site**: https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/  
**Repository**: https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_Landscape_Static  
**Google Sheet**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cR5X2xFSGffivfsMjyHDDeDJQv6R0kQpVUJsEJ2_1yY/edit
