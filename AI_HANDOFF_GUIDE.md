## FIRST ACTIONS (Before Any User Interaction)

**Do this IMMEDIATELY when joining a conversation:**

1. **Read orientation docs** (in order):
   - `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.txt` - Overview and orientation checklist
   - This file (`AI_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md`) - Code patterns and testing
   - `TESTING.md` - Testing commands and workflow
   
2. **Assess project state**:
   - Check git branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Check if `index.html` opens in browser (file://)
   - Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -5`
   - Check if any tests are failing
   
3. **Verify testing baseline**:
   - Run: `cd tests && python test_load.py`
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Open `index.html` in browser manually
   
4. **Present status to user** (without being asked):
   ```
   ## Current Status
   - **Branch**: [main / feat/feature-name]
   - **Feature**: [What's being worked on]
   - **Tests**: [Passing / Failing / Unknown]
   - **Browser**: [Works / Has errors]
   - **Ready**: [Yes / Need clarification on X]
   ```

**DO NOT** wait for the user to ask "where are we?" - be proactive.

## Context You Need

### What This Project Is

Interactive graph visualization for climate/restoration network mapping. **Pure static HTML/JavaScript** that loads data directly from Google Sheets.

**Key Difference from ERA_ClimateWeek:**
- NO Python server (that's the parent project)
- NO Flask, NO backend
- Just HTML + JavaScript + Google Sheets API
- Deployable to GitHub Pages (or any static host)

### Architecture

```
User opens: index.html (file:// or https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/)
  ‚Üì
Browser loads Google Sheets API libraries
  ‚Üì
Fetches data from Google Sheet (API key for read)
  ‚Üì
Renders interactive graph (vis-network.js)
  ‚Üì
User clicks "Sign In" (optional, for editing)
  ‚Üì
OAuth flow ‚Üí authenticated
  ‚Üì
User can save edits back to Sheet
```

**No server. No backend. Pure client-side.**

### Relationship to ERA_ClimateWeek

**Parent Project**: [ERA_ClimateWeek](https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_ClimateWeek)
- Python data processing pipeline
- Imports from CSV, transforms data
- Writes to Google Sheets
- Flask development server
- Generates HTML templates

**This Project** (ERA_Landscape_Static):
- Uses the data (reads from same Google Sheet)
- Pure client-side viewer
- No Python required
- Production-ready for GitHub Pages

**Workflow:**
```
ERA_ClimateWeek (Python) ‚Üí Process data ‚Üí Write to Google Sheets
                                              ‚Üì
                          ERA_Landscape_Static (HTML/JS) ‚Üí Read from Sheets ‚Üí Display
```

## CRITICAL DISCIPLINE (Core Principles)

### Your Predecessor's Approach

The AI assistant on ERA_ClimateWeek followed these principles - **YOU MUST TOO:**

1. **Test before claiming success** - Always verify with browser testing
2. **Small, incremental changes** - One feature at a time
3. **Never claim "fixed" without verification** - Test THEN report
4. **Respect user's time** - Be concise, don't hallucinate success
5. **Document everything** - Update docs after changes

### Red Flags You're Losing Context

- ‚ùå Making 3+ fixes in rapid succession without testing
- ‚ùå Saying "should work" instead of "tested, works"
- ‚ùå Not checking git log / current branch
- ‚ùå Assuming old docs are current
- ‚ùå Skipping the verification step
- ‚ùå Asking user to test before YOU test

### Recovery Steps

If you find yourself in a reactive loop:
1. **STOP** making changes
2. Read HANDOFF_SUMMARY.txt and this file
3. Check git log (what actually happened?)
4. Test current state in browser
5. Present status to user, ask for direction

---

## COMMAND OUTPUT DISCIPLINE

**CRITICAL RULE:** After EVERY command, READ and SUMMARIZE the output.

### The Problem

You can issue commands without reading their output. This leads to:
- Untracked files you don't notice
- Modified files you forget about
- Test failures you miss
- Broken state you don't detect

**Example failure:** Running `git status` 3 times, seeing "Untracked files: NEXT_STEPS.md" each time, but not noticing until user asks.

### The Fix

**After EVERY command, explicitly:**
1. Read the output
2. Check for unexpected results
3. Report what you found
4. Act on problems immediately

### Example: Good Workflow

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  NEXT_STEPS.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present
```

**AI Response:**
"‚ö†Ô∏è `git status` shows NEXT_STEPS.md is untracked. Should I commit it?"

### Example: Bad Workflow

```bash
$ git status
[output ignored]
```

**AI Response:**
"‚úÖ Everything committed" (WRONG - didn't read output)

---

## MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Test behavior, not structure. Hunt for problems, not confirmations.**

**Before claiming work is "done" or "complete":**

### 1. Test in the Target Environment

**BAD:** Testing file:// when it needs HTTP/HTTPS  
**GOOD:** Test in the actual deployment environment

```bash
# If deploying to GitHub Pages:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then test at http://localhost:8000
```

**Why:** Code that works in one environment may fail in another. API restrictions, CORS, protocol differences all matter.

### 2. Execute the User Workflow (Don't Just Check Code Exists)

**BAD:** "Does the function exist?" ‚úÖ  
**GOOD:** "Does the function produce the expected result when called?"

**Example:**
```python
# BAD test
exists = page.evaluate("() => typeof loadDataFromSheets === 'function'")
# Just checks code is defined

# GOOD test  
click_refresh_button()
wait(3 seconds)
data_changed = check_if_nodes_count_changed()
console_shows_success = check_console_for("Loaded from Sheets")
# Actually runs the workflow and checks outcome
```

### 3. Hunt for Problems (Pessimistic Testing)

**Assume broken until proven working.**

**Check console for ANY unexpected output:**
```python
# Get ALL console messages
console_messages = page.get_console_messages()

# Look for problems
errors = [m for m in messages if m.type == 'error']
warnings = [m for m in messages if m.type == 'warning']
missing_expected = check_for_expected_messages([
    "‚úÖ API initialized",
    "‚úÖ Data loaded"
])

# Report EVERY problem found
if errors or warnings or missing_expected:
    print("‚ùå Found problems:")
    for e in errors: print(f"  ERROR: {e}")
    for w in warnings: print(f"  WARNING: {w}")
```

**Don't ignore warnings!** "Failed to execute postMessage" may seem minor but reveals the API won't work.

### 4. Verify User-Visible Outcomes (Not Internal State)

**What the USER sees/experiences matters, not what variables exist.**

**Check the screen:**
- Does the button actually DO something when clicked?
- Does data change after "Refresh"?
- Does the Sign In button change state after OAuth?
- Does the graph update after "Save"?

**Example:**
```python
# BAD: Checking internal state
sheetsApiReady_exists = evaluate("typeof sheetsApiReady !== 'undefined'")  # True!

# GOOD: Checking user outcome
click_sign_in()
button_text_after = get_button_text('#signInBtn')
oauth_popup_opened = check_for_new_window()
# Does user see what they should see?
```

### 5. Wait for Async Operations to Complete

**If initialization is async, WAIT and verify completion.**

```python
# BAD
page.goto(url)
check_if_api_ready()  # Too early!

# GOOD  
page.goto(url)
wait_for_console_message("‚úÖ API initialized", timeout=5000)
# OR
wait(3 seconds)
check_console_for_completion_or_errors()
```

**If you see "üîß Initializing..." but never see "‚úÖ Initialized", that's a FAILURE.**

### 6. Git Status Check
```bash
git status
```

**Check for:**
- ‚úÖ "nothing to commit, working tree clean" OR
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Explain any untracked/modified files and why they're not committed

### 7. Git History Check
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

**Check for:**
- ‚úÖ All expected commits present
- ‚úÖ Latest commit has correct message
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any uncommitted work?

---

## TESTING ANTI-PATTERNS (What NOT to Do)

### ‚ùå Confirmation Hunting
```python
‚úÖ Function exists
‚úÖ Button exists  
‚úÖ Library loaded
‚Üí "Integration complete!"  # WRONG - you didn't test if it WORKS
```

### ‚ùå Testing Structure Instead of Behavior
```python
# Checks code is there, not that it runs
typeof myFunction === 'function'  # ‚úÖ exists
myFunction()  # Did you check what happens?
```

### ‚ùå Ignoring Console Warnings
```
[warning] Failed to execute postMessage...
```
"That's just a warning, ignore it" ‚Üí WRONG! This reveals the API can't initialize.

### ‚ùå Testing in Wrong Environment
Testing file:// when it needs HTTP ‚Üí You won't discover the actual problem.

### ‚ùå Not Waiting for Async
Checking API readiness immediately after calling async init() ‚Üí False positive.

---

## TESTING BEST PRACTICES (What TO Do)

### ‚úÖ Problem-Focused Testing
```
1. Look for errors in console
2. Look for missing expected messages  
3. Try the actual user workflow
4. Check if outcome matches expectation
5. Only THEN claim it works
```

### ‚úÖ User Outcome Verification
"After clicking Refresh, does the graph data actually update?"  
"After clicking Sign In, does OAuth popup appear?"  
"After clicking Save, does console show save succeeded?"

### ‚úÖ Environment-Aware Testing
"This requires HTTP, so I'll test with a local server."  
"This needs OAuth, so I'll test the redirect flow."  
"This writes to filesystem, so I'll verify the file was created."

---

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**Don't claim it works until you've seen it work in the conditions where it needs to work.**

Not: "The code is there" ‚úÖ  
But: "I used it like a user would, and it produced the expected result" ‚úÖ

### After Every File Creation

**When you create files:**
1. Create file ‚Üí `write_to_file` tool
2. Verify exists ‚Üí `ls -la [directory]`
3. Check git sees it ‚Üí `git status`
4. Stage it ‚Üí `git add [file]`
5. Verify staged ‚Üí `git status` (should show "Changes to be committed")
6. Commit ‚Üí `git commit -m "..."`
7. Verify committed ‚Üí `git log --oneline -1`

**DO NOT skip steps 2, 3, 5, 7.** Always verify.

## Code Patterns to Follow

### 1. Google Sheets API Integration

```javascript
// Configuration (in index.html)
const SHEET_ID = '1cR5X2xFSGffivfsMjyHDDeDJQv6R0kQpVUJsEJ2_1yY';
const API_KEY = 'AIzaSyBp23GwrTURmM3Z1ERZocotnu3Tn96TmUo';
const CLIENT_ID = '57881875374-flipnf45tc25cq7emcr9qhvq7unk16n5.apps.googleusercontent.com';

// Initialize API (in graph.js or inline)
function initSheetsApi() {
  gapi.load('client', async () => {
    await gapi.client.init({
      apiKey: API_KEY,
      discoveryDocs: ['https://sheets.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v4']
    });
    // Ready to read
  });
}

// Read data (API key - no auth needed)
async function readSheetTab(tabName) {
  const response = await gapi.client.sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
    spreadsheetId: SHEET_ID,
    range: `${tabName}!A:Z`
  });
  return response.result.values;
}

// Write data (requires OAuth)
async function writeSheetTab(tabName, data) {
  if (!sheetsApiReady) {
    // Trigger sign-in
    handleSignIn();
    return;
  }
  await gapi.client.sheets.spreadsheets.values.update({
    spreadsheetId: SHEET_ID,
    range: `${tabName}!A1`,
    valueInputOption: 'RAW',
    resource: { values: data }
  });
}
```

### 2. Node ID Convention

```javascript
// Always use typed IDs (same as parent project)
person::Jonathan Lever
org::Fetzer Institute  
project::ERA Africa

// Extract type from ID
const type = id.startsWith('person::') ? 'person' : 
             id.startsWith('project::') ? 'project' : 'organization';
```

### 3. vis-network DataSet

```javascript
// Initialize graph data
const nodes = new vis.DataSet([...]);
const edges = new vis.DataSet([...]);

// Get all nodes (returns array)
const allNodes = nodes.get();

// Update node
nodes.update({id: 'person::Jon', label: 'Jon Schull'});

// Add edge
edges.add({from: 'person::Jon', to: 'org::ERA', label: 'founded'});
```

### 4. Hidden State

```javascript
// Hide node (also hides connected edges)
nodes.update({id: nodeId, hidden: true});
const connectedEdges = edges.get().filter(e => 
  e.from === nodeId || e.to === nodeId
);
edges.update(connectedEdges.map(e => ({id: e.id, hidden: true})));
```

---

## Common Gotchas

### 1. File Protocol Limitations

```javascript
// ‚ùå Won't work from file://
fetch('/graph.js')  // Relative paths fail

// ‚úÖ Works from file://
<script src="./graph.js"></script>  // Or inline the script
```

### 2. gapi Loading Timing

```javascript
// ‚ùå Wrong - gapi might not be loaded yet
initSheetsApi();

// ‚úÖ Right - wait for gapi to load
window.onload = () => {
  if (window.gapi) {
    initSheetsApi();
  }
};
```

### 3. OAuth vs API Key

```javascript
// Reading (API key) - no sign-in
// Sheet must be public ("Anyone with link can view")
const data = await readSheetTab('nodes');

// Writing (OAuth) - requires sign-in
// User must click "Sign In" button first
await writeSheetTab('nodes', data);  // Will fail if not authenticated
```

### 4. Browser Compatibility

```javascript
// ‚ùå Might not work in older browsers
const data = await fetch(...);

// ‚úÖ Better - check for support
if ('fetch' in window) {
  // Modern browser
} else {
  // Fallback or error message
}
```

## Git Workflow (Standard Operating Procedure)

**Same workflow as ERA_ClimateWeek. It worked.**

### Before Making Changes

```bash
# 1. Ensure on main and up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify baseline (open in browser, check console)
open index.html
# Check: No errors, graph displays

# 3. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/feature-description
```

### During Development

```bash
# Make small changes, test immediately, commit frequently
git add index.html graph.js
git commit -m "feat: Add feature description"

# Push to remote periodically
git push origin feat/feature-description
```

### After Completing Work

```bash
# 1. Final browser test
open index.html
# Verify: Feature works, no console errors

# 2. Run Playwright test
cd tests
python test_load.py

# 3. Push final changes
git push origin feat/feature-description

# 4. Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat: Feature description" \
             --body "Description of changes"

# 5. Wait for review and merge
# 6. Update local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/feature-description
```

### Every Functional Stable State is a PR

Don't accumulate changes. When feature works and tests pass ‚Üí PR ‚Üí merge.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Workflow

**For every change:**

1. **Manual browser test** (FIRST)
   ```bash
   open index.html
   # Check console (Cmd+Option+J)
   # Test the feature
   # Verify no errors
   ```

2. **Playwright test** (SECOND)
   ```bash
   cd tests
   python test_load.py  # Or specific test
   ```

3. **Ask user to verify** (THIRD)
   ```
   "Feature tested and working. Please verify:
   - Open index.html
   - Test [specific action]
   - Confirm [expected result]"
   ```

4. **Screenshot if visual** (OPTIONAL but helpful)
   ```python
   page.screenshot(path="feature_working.png")
   ```

### Browser Compatibility

**Target browsers:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome 118+ (primary)
- ‚úÖ Edge 118+ (test this too)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox 119+ (nice to have)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari 17+ (nice to have)

**Test in both Chrome AND Edge before claiming success.**

### Manual Checklist

**Basic functionality:**
- [ ] index.html opens without errors
- [ ] Graph displays
- [ ] Data loads from Sheets (or embedded fallback)
- [ ] Toolbar buttons work
- [ ] Quick Editor can add/remove edges
- [ ] Search filtering works
- [ ] Save button works (if signed in)

**Console check:**
- [ ] No red errors in console
- [ ] API calls succeed (check Network tab)
- [ ] No "failed to load" messages

---

## Communication Style

### With the User

- **Be concise** - No verbose explanations
- **Test before claiming success** - Show proof (screenshot, test output)
- **Ask when uncertain** - Don't guess
- **Update docs** - Keep this guide current
- **Never say "should work"** - Say "tested, works" with evidence

### Example Good Response

```
‚úÖ Feature implemented and tested

Changes:
- Added Sign In button to toolbar
- Integrated OAuth flow
- Tested in Chrome and Edge

Evidence:
- test_load.py passes
- Console shows no errors
- [screenshot.png] shows button works

Please verify: Open index.html, click "Sign In", confirm OAuth popup appears.
```

### Example Bad Response

```
I've added the Sign In button. It should work now.
```

**Why bad?** No testing, no evidence, no specifics.

---

## File Organization

### Keep Clean

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `graph.js` - JavaScript (or inline if needed)
- `*.md` - Documentation
- `tests/` - Test scripts

### Don't Create

- Unnecessary helper files
- Complex directory structures  
- Multiple versions of index.html
- Build scripts (keep it simple!)

---

## When to Ask for Help

### Uncertain About

- UX decisions ("Should this button be here?")
- Breaking changes ("This will change existing behavior")
- API limits ("Will this hit rate limits?")
- Security concerns ("Is hardcoding API key safe?")

### Don't Ask About

- Implementation details (you can figure it out)
- Syntax questions (you know JavaScript)
- Testing approach (follow the workflow above)

---

## Success Criteria

### You're Doing Well If

- ‚úÖ Changes are small and testable
- ‚úÖ Browser tests pass before claiming success
- ‚úÖ Documentation stays current
- ‚úÖ User can verify what you did
- ‚úÖ Can rollback via git if needed

### Red Flags

- ‚ùå "It should work" without browser testing
- ‚ùå Multiple features in one change
- ‚ùå Breaking existing functionality
- ‚ùå Undocumented changes
- ‚ùå No commit before risky change
