# Next Steps for ERA_Landscape_Static

## ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED!

**Live Site**: https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/

## What We Completed

### Phase 1: Google Sheets API Integration ✅
- Added Google API libraries (gapi, OAuth2)
- Implemented read/write functions
- Wired Refresh/Save buttons
- Added Sign In button for OAuth
- Created integration test (8/8 passing)
- Documented HTTP/HTTPS requirement

### Phase 2: Color Fixes & DRY Refactoring ✅
- Fixed colors to match legend (person=blue, org=teal, project=purple)
- Added `parseTypeFromId()` to extract type from ID prefix
- Added `getNodeVisuals()` for DRY color/shape logic
- Fixed legend triangle color (#ff9800 → #ce93d8)

### Phase 3: Remove Embedded Data & Auto-Load ✅
- Removed ~110KB of embedded JSON data
- File size: 131KB → 20KB (85% reduction)
- Implemented auto-load on page init
- Always shows fresh data from Google Sheet
- Zero embedded data - single source of truth

### Phase 4: GitHub Pages Deployment ✅
- Enabled GitHub Pages (main branch, root folder)
- Configured auto-deploy on push
- Live at: https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/
- Verified: 353 nodes loading, no errors
- Build time: ~1-2 minutes

### Phase 5: Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated README with deployment procedures
- Updated DEVELOPMENT with testing procedures
- Added GitHub Pages update workflow
- Documented HTTP/HTTPS requirement throughout

## Current Status

**Repository**: https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_Landscape_Static  
**Live Site**: https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready

**Key Metrics:**
- File size: 20KB (was 131KB)
- Load time: ~2-3 seconds (including API init + data fetch)
- Node count: ~350+ (live from Sheet)
- Tests passing: 8/8
- Zero embedded data

**What Works:**
- ✅ Auto-loads fresh data from Google Sheets on page load
- ✅ Interactive graph (drag, zoom, pan)
- ✅ Color-coded by type (matches legend)
- ✅ Search/filter functionality
- ✅ Refresh button (re-fetch from Sheet)
- ✅ Sign In (OAuth) for editing
- ✅ Save changes back to Sheet
- ✅ GitHub Pages auto-deployment

## How to Update the Live Site

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
code index.html  # or graph.js

# 2. Test with HTTP server (REQUIRED)
python3 -m http.server 8000
open http://localhost:8000

# 3. Verify in console:
# - "✅ Google Sheets API client initialized"
# - "✅ Loaded XXX nodes, YYY edges from Sheets"
# - "🎉 Initial data load complete"

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push

# 5. Wait for deployment (~1-2 minutes)
gh api repos/jonschull/ERA_Landscape_Static/pages/builds/latest | jq -r '.status'

# 6. Verify live site
open https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are nice-to-haves, not critical:

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Improve loading screen with progress indicator
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Export graph as PNG/SVG
- [ ] Export data as CSV

### Features
- [ ] Curation modal for bulk organization editing
- [ ] Batch operations (hide/show multiple nodes)
- [ ] Advanced search (by type, connections, etc.)
- [ ] Node clustering/grouping
- [ ] Timeline view (if date data available)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (connection stats, etc.)

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support (cache Sheet data)
- [ ] PWA manifest (install as app)
- [ ] TypeScript conversion for type safety
- [ ] Separate CSS file (currently inline)
- [ ] Add tests for graph.js functions
- [ ] Performance optimization for >1000 nodes

**Philosophy**: Keep it simple unless there's a real need. Current implementation is production-ready.

## Project Architecture

**Simple Path (Current):**
```
Browser → Google Sheets API → Fetch Data → Render Graph
   ↓                                           ↓
Sign In → OAuth → Edit Graph → Save → Write to Sheet
```

**Benefits:**
- No server needed
- No Python needed  
- No build step
- Deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, S3, etc.)
- Can email as HTML attachment (works with HTTP server)

## Relationship to ERA_ClimateWeek

### ERA_ClimateWeek (Python)
**Repository**: https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_ClimateWeek  
**Purpose**: Data processing pipeline

**Use for:**
- Importing from CSV
- Batch data transformations
- Complex data processing
- Development/testing with Flask

**Location**: `/Users/admin/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox-EcoRestorationAllianceLLC/Jon Schull/CascadeProjects/ClimateWeek`

### ERA_Landscape_Static (This Project)
**Repository**: https://github.com/jonschull/ERA_Landscape_Static  
**Live Site**: https://jonschull.github.io/ERA_Landscape_Static/  
**Purpose**: Production viewer with direct Sheet integration

**Use for:**
- Public deployment
- Viewing the graph
- Simple editing via browser
- No server/Python required

**Workflow:**
```
ERA_ClimateWeek (Python)
  ↓ Process CSV data
  ↓ Transform and validate
  ↓ Write to Google Sheet
  ↓
ERA_Landscape_Static (HTML/JS)
  ↓ Read from Google Sheet
  ↓ Display in browser
  ↓ Users can edit
  ↓ Save back to Sheet
```
